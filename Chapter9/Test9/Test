1. Throwable
2. If the class that we are going to use throws an exception we need to put that inside try and catch the exception
3. vals[18] = 10; needs to be inside try block
4. Then JVM catches the exception and stops the execution of our program, prints the Stack track
5. Unreachable code in catch (B exc)
6. Yes
7. True. It eis executed when a try block ends
8. All types except Runtime Exception and Error
9. In order to throw an exception it must first inherit from a Throwable class, only them can be thrown
11. First by an error in JVM, second by an error in your program, by explicitly throwing via throw statement
12. Exception, Error
13. It is a feature which allows us to catch multiple exceptions in one catch clause
14. No, it can't catch them. They are interior errors by JVM.
